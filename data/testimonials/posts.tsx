I want to extend my gratitude to Mr. Vimal Daga for sharing his expertise and making the masterclass a truly exceptional learning experience. One of the highlights was our exploration of managing Jenkins pipelines as code, employing tools like Jenkins Kubernetes CRD and Grafana Loki. What's remarkable is that we completed a full-fledged DevOps project within a condensed 3-hour session, which is a testament to Mr. Vimal Daga's exceptional teaching`,
